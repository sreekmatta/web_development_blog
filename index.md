## Experiments with Web Application Development

This website is about my experiences and experiments in developing web applications using various latest technologies like Angular, React, Redux, React-Native, Spring-Boot etc.

### About Me

I am Sree Keerthi Matta. I loving coding since the age of 10. I have been writing code since then. I am a Masters student at Northeastern University, Boston. Writing blogs was never so much my passion but once I started working as a Teaching assistant for my favorite course Web Development during my Masters, I discovered that I am a passionate writer too (I mean passionate blogger for code). So, here I will share my experiments and experiences with latest technologies and my learnings from the bugs and issues I faced during application development.
